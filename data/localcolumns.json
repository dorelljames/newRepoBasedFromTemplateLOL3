The genesis of Ladies in Black actually happened at Brisbane Airport where Tim Finn was looking for a book to read, bought The Women in Black and on reading it, was compelled to call Simon Phillips and plant the seed for a stage production. On the plane, he started writing the music.\n\nThe cast and all dates and further detail will be announced at the national launch event to be held on August 15 in Sydney."},{"title":"Thirsty Merc Announce Summertime ‘Shifting Gears’ Shows!","mainimage":"/localcolumns/587499d2c2fd020b3b97b6fa_1484036562930-image5.jpg","thumbnail":"/localcolumns/587499d2c2fd020b3b97b6fa_1484036562930-image5.jpg","category":"Entertainment","shortdesc":"Cumque hic officia reprehenderit sequi nemo.Consectetur ab deserunt reiciendis.","postbody":"In the past 12 months Thirsty Merc have been one of the busiest bands in the country crisscrossed the nation at least 5 times, done over 90 shows and ran up over 100,000 Frequent Flier miles between them. \n\nWith the temperature rising, and Spring and Summer calling, Rai Thistlethwayte, Phil Stack and Matt Smith, with Mick Skelton on select shows, will work their way around Australia once more from now until Autumn, 2017 on the **Shifting Gears Tour.**\n\nKicking off with a crowdfunding campaign in mid 2015, **Thirsty Merc** released their new, original album, **Shifting Gears**, last September and the band immediately hit the road on **The Good Life Tour**.

With Gelmetti, Dane led the Sydney Symphony on tour as well as in the Sydney Opera House as well as spending three summers studying at Siena’s _Accademia Musicale Chigiana_.

Dane conducted the XSO at the 2016 CCTV1 Mid-Autumn Festival Gala which was televised live around China and internationally to an audience exceeding one billion views while presiding over a period of financial security for the organisation and forging international partnerships.

Goodes - in a city on the cusp of becoming cosmopolitan: Sydney is crossing the threshold between the stuffy repression of the 1950s and the glorious liberation of the 1960s. Donning a distinguished black dress, the bright-eyed, bookish school leaver Lisa is about to join the ranks on the sales floor of the city’s most prestigious department store – temporarily, of course. Her domineering dad intends to railroad her into a career as a secretary, but Lisa has grander schemes in mind. In that summer of innocence, a world of possibilities opens up as she befriends the unlucky Fay and the frustrated Patty. Then the exotic, compelling European refugee, Magda, mysterious mistress of the model gowns, takes Lisa under her wing. From the Christmas rush to the chaos of the sales, these women stand shoulder to padded shoulder and together learn lessons in life, love and longing – and at the end, it’s not just the fancy frocks that are forever altered.\n\n**_Ladies in Black_** – **national tour**\n\n**Cast Includes:** Kate Cole, Carita Farrer Spencer, Bobby Fox, Natalie Gamsu, Madeleine Jones, Kathryn McIntyre, Trisha Noble, Ellen Simpson, Greg Stone, Tamlyn Henderson and Sarah Morrison as Lisa.\n\n**Musical Director:**David Young \n\n**Orchestrations:** Guy Simpson\n\n**Designer**: Gabriela Tylesova \n\n**Lighting Designer:** David Walters  \n**Website:**ladiesinblack.com.au #ladiesinblack2017\n\n**Sydney – Sydney Lyric Theatre**\n\n3 – 22 January 2017\n\nPhone: 1300 795 267\n\nTicketmaster.com.au or sydneyfestival.org.au\n\n**Brisbane – Playhouse, QPAC**\n\n28 January – 19 February 2017\n\nPhone: 136 246 or queenslandtheatre.co.au\n\n**Melbourne – Regent Theatre**\n\n25 February – 18 March 2017\n\nPhone: 1300 111 011\n\n**Canberra – Canberra Theatre Centre**\n\n27 March – 2 April 2017\n\nPhone: (02) 6275 2700 or canberratheatrecentre.com.au\n\n**The best Aussie musical since Priscilla went global – _The Age_**\n\n**An immensely engaging score filled with generous melodies – _The Australian_**\n\n**A theatrical triumph – _The Courier-Mail_**\n\n**This is an ensemble of world class quality –_Limelight Magazine_**\n\n**Tim Finn is a musical genius – _The Courier-Mail_**\n\n**Heart-warming, funny and charmingly Australian – _The Music_**\n\n  So as you know, LA LA LAND won a record breaking seven Golden Globes from seven nominations,  including best motion picture, musical or comedy.\n\nThis is a fantastic hook for us with Ladies in Black opening January 28 for a return ENCORE SEASON through Queensland Theatre ….. if you loved La La Land (like the HFPA did at the Golden Globes last night)….
